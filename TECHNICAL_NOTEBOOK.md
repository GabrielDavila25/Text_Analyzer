  - `cleantext` for general text cleaning

#### Analysis Layer
- Implements multiple analysis strategies:
  - Entity Recognition (spaCy)
  - Sentiment Analysis (TextBlob)
  - Topic Modeling (Gensim)
  - Text Statistics (textstat)
  - Document Similarity (TF-IDF)

    # Handles entity relationship mapping
```

#### Topic Evolution Visualization
```python
def create_topic_visualization(texts: List[str], num_topics: int = 5):
    # Uses Gensim for LDA topic modeling
    # Implements interactive heatmap visualization
    # Handles topic-keyword relationships
```

#### Document Flow Analysis
```python
def create_temporal_analysis(text: str):
    # Tracks multiple metrics through document
    # Implements multi-line plotting
    # Handles sentence-level analysis
```

### 3. AI Integration Architecture

#### Prompt Template System
```python
class PromptTemplate:
    # Manages structured prompts for different analysis tasks
    # Implements template formatting
    # Handles context injection
```

#### Output Parser System
```python
class OutputParser:
    # Handles JSON response parsing
    # Implements error handling
    # Manages structured output formatting
```
